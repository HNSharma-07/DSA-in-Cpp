# DSA with C++🚀
Fundametals and Problem solving at core⚡
<hr>

## Description:📝
- This is a repository of my ongoing DSA journey.
- The main purpose of this project is to document my learnings.
- Also i am trying to make this repository as cureted as possible by separating files into well organized folders, adding comments so that any one can understand it.

### Why C++ ? 🤔
- Object Oriented language with functional programming
- Strong community support for DSA
- Comparatively very fast for CP
- STL (Standered Tempted Library) support
- Makes fundamental very strong like; memory management, pointers, give full control to user
- Easy for shifting to new technology as your programming basic is strong
- Legacy of C Language 👑

### Topics Done:✅
- Basics of Programming (C++)
- OOPs concept in details
- Recursion
- Sorting Algorithms
